# Solutions

This year was completed in Java. Each day is separated out, with generally a class to encapsulate each day's solution. Additional documentation notes can be found in the day`*_algo.txt file in each folder which is the pseudocode outline for each Part A solution.

# Manager Solutions

As a tongue-in-cheek joke the first couple days, I answered the problems in "manager" language. It turns out this was kind of a fun exercise, which I've continued daily in addition to the actual programming puzzles. Links to each day's threads below.
