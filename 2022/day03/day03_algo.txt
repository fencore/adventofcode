Build a function to return the priority int value of the input char, must be case sensitive - do this in a separate class file since it'll probably be needed in P2

Main:
Declare string bagContents
Declare int prioritySum
Open input.txt

Start outer loop, continue while file has more contents
	Read line into bagContents
	Start middle FOR loop,  iterator i, continue until either iterator 		is bagContents length / 2 OR find a char match
		Start inner FOR loop, iterator j, continue until either is 			bagContents length OR find a char match
			Compare bagContents[i] and bagContents[j]
			If match, prioritySum += LookupFunctionValue
		End inner loop
	End middle loop
End outer loop

Print prioritySum to screen
