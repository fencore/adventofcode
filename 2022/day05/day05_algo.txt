Hand-reformatted initial state input. Andy can't tell me how to live my life.

=====Reading input state into 2D array=====
Open file
Loop - for incrementer i = 0, while line read in is not empty, i++
    Inner Loop to iterate through read string
        push char to stack
    End inner loop
    Add now complete stack to list
End Loop

=====processing move instructions=====
Outer Loop - while file has contents
    read line into split string, array of 3 ints, position 1 is quantity, position 2 is source stack, position 3 is destination stack. (moveInstruction)
    inner loop - for incrementer i = 0, while i < moveInstruction[0], i++
        push to cargoList[moveInstruction[2]] char that is popped from cargoList[moveInstruction[1]]
    End inner loop
End outer loop

loop - for incrementer i = 0, while i is less than the first dimension of the two dimensional array, i++
    peek top crate of each stack, assign to string topCratesList
end loop

print topCratesList to screen
