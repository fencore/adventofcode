Make a monkey class
    -arr variable to hold current items
    -operator variable to determine + or *
    -factor to pair with operator
    -target if test true
    -target if test false
    -test? how can i include the test in the class?

    Methods:
    worryCheck - modify worry value based on algorithm provided, void
    throwItem - pops item value, integer, will need to call testCriteria, return -1 to end
    catchItem - receives a thrown item, void
    testCriteria - evaluates criteria prior to throw, boolean
    constructor - needs item list array, the operator, operator factor, target true, and target false

Make a Monkey-facilitator class. Goof Troop.
    -Array of Monkeys
    -thrown item variable to act as intermediary?

    Methods:
    - Call monkey array action atates in turn until -1 received
    -Intermediary catchItem
    - Intemediary throwItem
    addMonkey method to call Monkey constructor


Main

Declare the monkey classes to fill the GoofTroop array
